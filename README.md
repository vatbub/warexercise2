#WarExercise
No, I am not training for any kind of war scenario, I am a peaceful developer who just wanted to learn how to write Java WebApps, how to export them as war files and how [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) works.

So this is just another [Hello World app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) which even has a readme (hurray :) )

OK, now let's be serious. If you want to learn how to do it you, you can take that as an example. If you browse the commit history, you will see that I tried many many frameworks and configs (which mostly failed :( ) and now ended up with a very simple Hello World web page which is (hopefully) accessible [here](https://hello-world-45536.herokuapp.com/).
